  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/res/assets/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Black.ttf
        - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Medium.ttf
        - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Bold.ttf
  #   - family: Gilroy
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Black.ttf
  #       - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: lib/res/theme/fonts/Gilroy-SemiBold.ttf
